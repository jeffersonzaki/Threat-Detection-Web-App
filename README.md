# Threat Detection Web App
There have been many mass shootings over the year, and each year it has been increasing. Many people lose their lives because the threat wasn't neutralized early enough. Cameras rely on human eyes to detect such actions and a human's eye/reaction time is quite frankly just not good enough.

We can lower casualties in mass shootings earlier by having a computer do the work for us. What if a computer is able to detect a threat before it begans?

This work helps approach the problem to find a solution.
